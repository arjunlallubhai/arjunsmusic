<p>The songs in this list are songs that have good guitar solos. They aren’t really based on skill, but how they sound. They are in no particular order, except for not having similar colored album covers together. This page has the song, when it was released, a little background about the guitarist, and a little bit about the solo. But I find it hard to explain guitar techniques and notes in words, so there is not much of a detail about the riffs, but if you want to, you can search them up on <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/" target="_blank">Ultimate guitar</a>, and learn it yourself.

<h2>COMFORTABLY NUMB - Pink Floyd</h2>    
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-xTttimcNk" target="_blank"><img src="The%20Wall.jfif" height="450" width="450" title="The Wall - Pink Floyd (1979)" alt="The Wall - Pink Floyd (1979)" height=450 width=450 class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1979 as a single by Pink Floyd, in their album ‘The Wall’. This guitar solo is played by David Gilmour, who is one of the best guitarists of all time. There is one solo after verse 1 and chorus 1. Then there is the outro solo after verse 2 and chorus 2. </p>
    <p>I found the first solo to be relatively easy, but for the second solo, I don’t think that I have actually played the whole solo to the very end many times. It is probably because it is a bit long, or it might be because I just don’t know the perfect timings. The first solo is short, about 30 seconds, and has arpeggios, sliding, vibrato, and muted notes. The outro solo is longer, around 1 minute 40 seconds. It starts in the lower frets and lower strings, but for the second half, it goes up, and the song fades out there. This solo is considered the best by many people, and tops most ‘Best solos of all time’ lists.

<h2>SULTANS OF SWING - Dire Straits</h2>    
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fAQhSRLQnM" target="_blank"><img src="Dire%20Straits.jpg" height="450" width="450" title="Dire Straits - Dire Straits (1978)" alt="Dire Straits - Dire Straits (1978)" height=450 width=450 class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1978 by Dire Straits, in their album ‘Dire Straits’. The solo is played by Mark Knopfler, the man who plays in a unique style, distinctive from everyone else’s.  He uses his thumb and two fingers to pick, and his blues-style playing makes his songs unique. 
</p>
<p>Unlike the other solos, this solo does not have hard sounds, with the amp cranked up. It is quiet and gentle, but fast and skilled. The solo uses lots of bending, and you also need quick fingers, to play all of the many arpeggios. This song will take time to learn, but it will feel good once you get it, because this is one of the hardest solos that I know of.

         <h2>BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY - Queen</h2>    
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taahRSkqIE" target="_blank"><img src="A%20night%20at%20the%20opera.png" height="450" width="450" alt="A night at the opera - Queen (1975)" title="A night at the opera - Queen (1975)" height=450 width=450 class="album"></a>
<p>This song was released in 1975 as a single by Queen, in their album ‘A Night at the Opera’. This solo is played by Brian May, whose trademark was to play with a sixpence coin as a pick, on his signature guitar which he made with his dad. If you know this song, you should know that this song shifts genres in the songs. There is one solo after the piano part, one guitar part after the opera part, and a little outro guitar at the end. 
</p>
    <p>The solo is short and sharp, but it is still a great solo. All the guitar parts are used to separate the different genres within the song. It is used in the transitioning phase. The main solo is played with pre-bends and vibratos, and I think that it is a great solo to play. It is a bit fast for beginners, but that was the first solo that I learned.  This solo usually takes 4th on the list for the best guitar solos. 
</p>
     
<h2>HOTEL CALIFORNIA - The Eagles</h2>    
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BciS5krYL80" target="_blank"><img src="Hotel%20California.jpg" height="450" width="450" title="Hotel California - The Eagles (1976)" alt="Hotel California - The Eagles (1976)" class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1976 as a single by The Eagles, in their album ‘Hotel California’. The solo is played by Don Felder, which also features Joe Walsh backing him up. The solo is a minute long, and has the outro that most people recognise. Even though it is a two guitar song, you can still play it on your own. 
</p>
<p>The solo has bends and slides, and lots of vibrato. It is a cool solo to be able to play, because everyone knows it. Even if they don't know the first part they will definitely know the ending. This song and its solo always comes near the top for top songs and top solos. It is moderately fast paced and fun to play.

<h2>STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN - Led Zeppelin</h2>    
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIReHbOmU1U" target="_blank"><img src="Untitled.jpg" height="450" width="450" title="Led Zeppelin IV - Led Zeppelin (1971)" alt="Led Zeppelin IV - Led Zeppelin (1971)" class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1971 as a single by Led Zeppelin, in their album which was untitled, but is commonly known as ‘Led Zeppelin IV’. The solo is played by Jimmy Page, who is one of the best guitarists. The riff is great, so that would have been in the riff section, had I not put in here. The first part is also a great acoustic song, so it would be in that list too. But the solo is great.  
</p>
<p>Like ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’, the guitar solo here is used to transition from the soft acoustic part to the hard rock part. The first part of the solo is repetitive with changes, and is fast and full of bending and hammer-ons. Then the riff moves up, and uses the higher frets, until it changes to the hard rock last verse. There is also a little guitar part at the end, before Robert Plant’s ending vocal line, which takes some samples from the first solo, slowing it down. This song is normally rated relatively high in the Top 20 best songs ever, and this solo usually takes the 3rd spot. 
    <p>Just a fun fact, but I share the same birthday as Jimmy Page!!!</p>

<h2>REELIN IN THE YEARS - Steely Dan</h2>    
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaH25Sghoqc" target="_blank"><img src="Cant%20buy%20a%20thrill.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="Can't buy a thrill - Steely Dan (1972)" title="Can't buy a thrill - Steely Dan (1972)" height=450 width=450 class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1972 as a single by Steely Dan, in their album “Can’t buy a thrill”. The solo is played by Elliot Randall, and this solo was Jimmy Page’s favourite solo of all time. Despite being a good solo, I think that the solo is a bit underrated. I don’t see it on many ‘best solo’ lists.
</p>
    <p>The first part has 2 bars repeating, but moving up strings, and adding extra notes. It is a bit fast, but it is easy to do. There is also a second solo directly after the first solo, and is played on the higher frets. It is not really repetitive, and I think it is faster than the first solo. Then, the first solo is played again for the outro. The intro to this song is also worth playing as well. Maybe you should learn that first, before you start the solo, so that you can get a feel of the song.

<h2>PURPLE RAIN - Prince and the Revolution</h2>    
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6Y1gohk5-A" target="_blank"><img src="Purple%20Rain.jpg" height="450" width="450" title="Purple Rain - Prince and the Revolution (1984)" alt="Purple Rain - Prince and the Revolution (1984)" height=450 width=450 class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1984 as a single by Prince and The Revolution, in their album ‘Purple Rain’. The solo is played by Prince, and is a great solo. Prince doesn’t actually play much guitar in the song, until the end, for the 3 minutes outro solo. </p>
<p>
It’s simple, but it’s great, and all the parts are different, moving up and down, except for one part, which serves as a ‘chorus’ in the solo. There is a lot of bending, and lots of notes are played long, so it sounds like the guitar is wailing. I actually started learning this solo recently, so I can’t play it yet, but I think that it’s a great solo to learn.

<h2> CROSSROADS - Cream</h2>    
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYC5BcL7YtQ" target="_blank"><img src="Fresh%20cream.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="Fresh cream - Cream (1966)" title="Fresh cream - Cream (1966)" height=450 width=450 class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1966 as a single by Cream, in their album ‘Fresh Cream’. The solo is played by Eric Clapton, who is a famous guitarist who is not a heavy rocker. This song was a cover of an old blue song by Robert Johnson, called ‘Crossroad Blues’. 
</p>
        <p>The song has two solos, but which sound like a mix of blues and rock. Both solos are fast, and long, and maybe hard to play. Anyway, this is one of Eric Claptnon’s best guitar solos. If you want something easier, maybe try ‘Wonderful tonight’, which is pretty slow, and easy to play. 
</p><hr style="width:50%;text-align:center;margin-left:auto">
<h2> WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS - The Beatles</h2>    
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOKGcEfSwnY" target="_blank"><img src="White%20album.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt= "The Beatles - The Beatles (1968)" title="The Beatles - The Beatles (1968)" height=450 width=450 class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1968 as a single by The Beatles, in their album ‘The Beatles’, more commonly known as ‘The White Album’. The solo is actually played by Eric Clapton, who became the only guitarist to play on a Beatles album. 
        </p>
<p>This guitar solo was actually not played by a Beatle, but by Eric Clapotn. Beatles guitarist George Harrison thought that it would be better if he played the solo, than himself. This solo has a lot of bending included in this solo. It is a relatively slow tempo, so it may be easy to play along with. It's just that it has a lot of extreme bending in it, which may be a bit hard. 

</p><hr style="width:50%;text-align:center;margin-left:auto">

<h2>ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER - Jimi Hendrix</h2>    
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY" target="_blank"><img src="Electric%20Ladyland.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="Electric Ladyland - The Jimi Hendrix Experience (1968)" title="Electric Ladyland - The Jimi Hendrix Experience (1968)" height=400 width=40 class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released as a single in 1968 by Jimi Hendrix, in his album ‘Electric Ladyland’. This song was a cover of a Bob Dylan song, though even Bob Dylan says that Hendrix’s version is better. The solo is played by Jimi Hendrix, which has a lot of bending and sliding in it. Bob Dylan’s version had short harmonica solos, while Hendrix’s version had solid guitar solos. 

</p>
    
<p>This song has 3 guitar solos, after each verse, and one guitar part at the intro. This song has a lot of bending, muting, and you will need a pedal or some way to create an effect to make it sound like Hendrix. You will also need to tune the guitar down one semitone to match the original recording, or you can just play one standard tuning, subtracting 1 from every number on the tab. It’s very fast, so if you want something easier, try ‘Purple haze’.
