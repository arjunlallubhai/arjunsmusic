    <p>    The songs in this list are songs that have good guitar riffs. There are three pages, each for 
        <a href="Riffs%20-%20Easy.html">Easy</a>, 
        <a href="Riffs%20-%20Medium.html">Medium</a>, and 
        <a href="Riffs%20-%20Hard.html">Hard</a>.
        These riffs are mostly classic riffs that most people could recognise in an instant, and are great to play when you pick up your guitar, and want to play something simple as a warm up. 

But I find it hard to explain guitar techniques and notes in words, so there is not much of a detail about the riffs, but if you want to, you can search them up on Ultimate Guitar, and learn it yourself. 
This list includes songs from artists like The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and Nirvana.

<h2>(I CAN'T GET NO) SATISFACTION - The Rolling Stones</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSSxnv1_J2g" target="_blank"><img src="Out%20of%20our%20heads.jpg" title="Out of our heads - The Rolling Stones (1965)" alt="Out of our heads - The Rolling Stones (1965)" height="450" width="450" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
<p>This song was released as a single by The Rolling Stones in 1965, in their album ‘Out of our heads’. The Rolling Stone guitarist, Keith Richards, wrote this in his sleep, without even knowing it. He recorded the guitar part, then dropped his pick, and the rest of the recording was of him snoring. 
This riff is easy because it only uses 3 notes, all on the A string. This riff will be a good riff to practice hammer-ons and pull-offs, as all the notes are near each other, and easy to play.

<h2>OH, PRETTY WOMAN - Roy Orbison</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikweq0THs88" target="_blank"><img src="Pretty%20woman.jfif" height="450" width="450" title="Oh! Pretty Woman - Roy Orbison" alt="Oh! Pretty Woman - Roy Orbison" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
<p>This song was released as a single in 1964 by Roy Orbison. This riff is easy to play, though it is a bit fast-paced. There is the first part, and the second part, which builds upon the first part, with a few added notes.

<h2>SMOKE ON THE WATER - Deep Purple</h2>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xl4XJkVjQ" target="_blank"><img src="Machine%20Head.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="Machine Head - Deep Purple (1972)" title="Machine Head - Deep Purple (1972)" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
    <p>
 This song was released as a single by Deep Purple in 1972, on their album ‘Machine Head’ . This riff is on the list of riffs that are ‘forbidden’ to play at music stores. It is very easy to learn, and the sound is easily recognisable. This riff is good for practising moving between frets when beginning to learn to play tab.

<h2>YOU REALLY GOT ME - The Kinks</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ4uGV6Goy0" target="_blank"><img src="Kinks.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="Kinks - The Kinks (1978)" title="Kinks - The Kinks (1978)" class="album"></a>
<!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
<p>This song was released as a single in 1964 by The Kinks. This song was later covered by Van Halen in 1978, which has the great solo by Eddie Van Halen. The original version, The Kinks’ version, has a simple easy riff, of two power chords (F5 and G5) sliding up and down the fretboard. This riff sounds like ‘All day and all night’, which is another song by the Kinks, released in 1964. This song uses F5 and G5, with an A#5 added into the chord progression. </p>    <hr style="width:50%;text-align:center;margin-left:auto">
<h2>DAY TRIPPER - The Beatles</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IbPn5j2YKk" target="_blank"><img src="Yesterday%20and%20today.jpg" height="450" width="450" title="Yestday and Today - The Beatles (1966)" alt="Yestday and Today - The Beatles (1966)" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
<p>This song was released as a single in 1966 by The Beatles. This riff uses the bottom three strings (EAD) first, then transfers up to ADG), with the same melody being played. That riff is continued on through the verse. I think that it is a pretty cool riff to play </p>
 <hr style="width:50%;text-align:center;margin-left:auto">   
<h2>DON'T FEAR THE REAPER - Blue Oyster Cult</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4HA3vUv2c" target="_blank"><img src="Agents%20of%20Fortune.jpg" height="450" width="450" title="Agents of Fortune - Blue Oyster Cult (1976)" alt="Agents of Fortune - Blue Oyster Cult (1976)" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
<p>This song was released as a single in 1976 by Blue Oyster Cult, in their album ‘Agents of Fortune’. This riff is just 2 bars of strumming four strings without really moving your fingers. This riff is continued throughout the whole song, except for the pre-chorus and solo (the riff plays in the background of the solo). It may be hard to get everything at the right tempo, with every note being a quaver, and that there is no rest between the notes for the whole riff.

<h2>SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT - Nirvana</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyGNABrosb8" target="_blank"><img src="Nevermind.jpg" height="450" width="450" title="Nevermind - Nirvana (1991)" alt="Nevermind - Nirvana (1991)" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
<p>This song was released as a single in 1991 by Nirvana on their album ‘Nevermind’. The riff here is a 4 chord progression, with lots of muted strumming to make it sound like the grunge style riff. The chords are F5, A#5, G#5, and C#5. This riff sounds like the chorus riff for Boston’s ‘More than a feeling’, but this uses different chords, and is easier to play. 
</p><hr style="width:50%;text-align:center;margin-left:auto">
<h2>HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN - The Animals</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6M_gm5yNDU" target="_blank"><img src="The%20Animals.jpg"  alt="The Animals - The Animals (1964)" title="The Animals - The Animals (1964)" height="450" width="450" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
<p>This song was released as a single in 1964 by The Animals, in their album The Animals. This song was originally written in the ’30s and the lyricist is not known, but many artists have covered it, though this one remains the best. The riff is just plucking the string for each chord in the verse and remains the same throughout the whole song. A classic song, and a relaxing riff to play.
    </p>

<h2>ORDINARY WORLD - Duran Duran</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiB1CfNmgf8" target="_blank"><img src="Wedding%20album.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="Duran Duran - Duran Duran (1993)" title="Duran Duran - Duran Duran (1993)" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
<p>This song was released in 1993 as a single by Duran Duran, in their album ‘Duran Duran’, which is also known as the Wedding Album. The song has an acoustic intro, then a beautiful electric riff. The riff is pretty easy, but I just put it here, because beginners normally start with an acoustic, and this riff is hard to play on acoustic, as it uses frets over 12, so I put it in this section. The riff is played over the chord progression played by the acoustic, so if 2 guitarists play together, it sounds pretty good.

<h2>SUNSHINE OF YOU LOVE - Cream</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9k6aa4QvJ4" target="_blank"><img src="Disraeli%20Gears.jpg" title="Disraeli gears - Cream (1967)" alt="Disraeli gears - Cream (1967)" height="450" width="450" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
<p>This song was released in 1967 as a single by the supergroup Cream, in their album ‘Disraeli Gears’, which is one of the best psychedelic albums. The riff is played by Eric Clapton, who is no stranger when it comes to the world of guitar. Despite the name, the riff is easy, as one part is played once, and is repeated with a few added notes for the verse.
