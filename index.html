 <h1>Songs to play on guitar for all levels</h1>
<!--A little information about why I made this site-->
 <p>
The purpose of making this website is to recommend songs to play on guitar. I have included songs for both electric and acoustic guitar for easy, medium, and hard levels. There is also a section for riffs, solos, and guitarists that you can choose to play songs from, or just listen to.  
</p>    

    <h2>About Me</h2>
<!--A little bit about me-->
<p>
My name is Arjun Lallubhai and I play the guitar and piano. I started playing acoustic guitar when I was 10, and stopped playing for a while. I started playing guitar again, when I was 13, and I started to play on the electric guitar as well. I am a fan of 60's, 70's, and 80's music, so most of the songs I play are from that era, meaning most of the songs in these lists will be from those decades. I made this because earlier when I started playing, I visited sites like this one, which recommended songs to play, depending on whether you are experienced or a beginner, like riffs or solos. So here, I have made different pages for riffs, <a href="Solos.html">solos</a>, and <a href="Guitarists.html">guitarists</a>, with the riffs section being dived into <a href="Riffs%20-%20Easy.html">Easy</a>, <a href="Riffs%20-%20Medium.html">Medium</a>, and <a href="Riffs%20-%20Hard.html">Hard</a>.

  <h1>How to practice and get better</h1>      
<p>
Practice it slowly, breaking it down. When you do it over and over, you will develop muscle memory, so you will be able to play it faster, and without looking. You should also play along with the original track after you learn to play it at the right speed, so you know if you are doing it right or not. You might have always thought of one part to be played a certain way, but when you play along, you find out that you were playing it wrong the whole time. You can also play with the original track so you can get the timing and tempo right, so it is a very good thing to play along. Make sure you keep practising consistently.
