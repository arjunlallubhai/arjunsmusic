    <p>The songs in this list are songs that have good guitar riffs. There are three pages, each for 
        <!--The following three <a> tags link to their respective pages-->
        <a href="Riffs%20-%20Easy.html">Easy</a>, 
        <a href="Riffs%20-%20Medium.html">Medium</a>, and 
        <a href="Riffs%20-%20Hard.html">Hard</a>.
        These riffs are mostly classic riffs that most people could recognise in an instant, and are great to play when you pick up your guitar, and want to play something simple as a warm up.

But I find it hard to explain guitar techniques and notes in words, so there is not much of a detail about the riffs, but if you want to, you can search them up on Ultimate Guitar, and learn it yourself. 
This list includes songs from artists like Black Sabbath, David Bowie, and Pink Floyd.

<h2>AMERICAN IDIOT - Green Day</h2>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyV54YwPAkk" target="_blank"><img src="American%20Idiot.png" height="450" width="450" alt="American Idiot - Green Day (2004)" title="American Idiot - Green Day (2004)" class="album"> </a> <!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
     <p>This song was released in 2004 as a single by Green Day, in their album ‘American Idiot’. This song is a rebellious, catchy song, saying things about the US. This is my personal favourite song from the 2000s. The riff uses 3 power chords, F#5, G#5, and C#5. This original song is tuned down to Eb, so tune it to that if you want to play the chords for the chorus correctly. Also, if you tune down to Eb, then move the riff up one fret, to match that tuning.

<h2>IRON MAN - Black Sabbath</h2>
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk_wUT1CvWM" target="blank"><img src="Paranoid.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="Paranoid - Black Sabbath (1970)" title="Paranoid - Black Sabbath (1970)" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
    <p>This song was released as a single in 1970 by Black Sabbath, one of the first metal bands, in their album ‘Paranoid’. The riff follows a steady beat, except for the end of each cycle, so should be easy to master. I have seen different versions of it, so choose one that you think sounds best, and what is easiest and comfortable to play. If you want to try something harder, I recommend playing ‘Paranoid’ because it is faster, and sounds more like a metal song.

<h2>MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE - The Police</h2>
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMl1xKJeuuQ" target="_blank"><img src="Reggatta%20de%20Blanc.jpg" height="450" width="450" title="Reggatta de Blanc - The Police (1979)" alt="Reggatta de Blanc - The Police (1979)" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
     <p>This song was released as a single in 1979 by The Police, on their album ‘Reggatta de Blanc’. The band was known for its mix of rock and reggae song, and Sting’s unique voice. The riff is played by Andy Summers, and maintains a similar hand shape for the whole riff, but requires a lot of moving up and down the fretboard and strings. If you want a song with a more ‘bass’ sound, then play ‘Every breath you take’, which is another song by The Police.

<h2>REBEL REBEL - David Bowie</h2>
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTIsnYPG4lU" target="_blank"><img src="Diamond%20dogs.jpg" title ="Diamond Dogs - David Bowie (1974)" alt="Diamond Dogs - David Bowie (1974)" height="450" width="450" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
     <p>This song was released in 1974 as a single by David Bowie, in his album ‘Diamond Dogs’. Just a fun fact, but if you have this album on vinyl, it is worth over $3500. The riff is played by Alan Parker, who played guitar for other tracks on the album. The riff might be a bit hard, as it has some notes that you may not be able to hear the first time you listen to the song. Let the strings ring, so that it sounds more like the actual song. Strum the A string at the start of the song, because I think that’s how it’s played.

<h2>WALK THIS WAY - Aerosmith</h2>
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c8O2n1Gfto" target="_blank"><img src="Toys_in_the_Attic.jpg" alt="Toys in the attic - Aerosmith (1975)" title="Toys in the attic - Aerosmith (1975)" height="450" width="450" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
     <p>This song was originally released in 1975 by Aerosmith in their album ‘Toys in the Attic’, but the more famous version is by Aerosmith with Run-D.M.C, which saved Aerosmith’s career. The riff is played by Joe Perry of Aerosmith. The riff is a bit fast-paced, but is relatively simple and repetitive. The riff for the verse is different, and goes up 10 frets, and has muted strings and is just constant notes, so try it if you want, but the intro riff is more recognised than the verse riff.

<h2>BACK IN BLACK - AC/DC</h2>
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vWNauaZAgg" target="_blank"><img src="Back%20in%20Black.png" title="Back in Black - AC/DC (1980)" alt="Back in Black - AC/DC (1980)" height="450" width="450" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
     <p>This song was released in 1980 by AC/DC, as a single in their album ‘Back in Black’ This album was the first AC/DC album after Bon Scott’s death, and with their new singer Brian Johnson. The riff is a classic rock riff, and is based around 3 chords, with guitar fills. This riff has bends, pull-offs, and chords, so it may be a bit challenging for some people. However, it is pretty easy once you get it, so have no fear.

<h2>BEAT IT - Michael Jackson</h2>
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOn-HdEg6AQ" target="_blank"><img src="Thriller.png" height="450" width="450" alt="Thriller - Michael Jackson(1982)" title="Thriller - Michael Jackson (1982)" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
<p>This song was released as a single in 1983 by Michael Jackson. This riff was played by Eddie Van Halen, who also played the rocking guitar solo in the middle, with Eddie’s signature tapping and trem picking. The thought of Eddie Van Halen playing the riff may cause you to think the riff is hard, but it is relatively easy, and is a very cool rock riff to play. If you want to play it to sound more like the original, then tune it one step down.

<h2>COME AS YOU ARE - Nirvana </h2>
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljUtuoFt-8c" target="_blank"><img src="Nevermind.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="Nevermind - Nirvana(1991)" title="Nevermind - Nirvana (1991)" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
    <p>This song was released as a single in 1991 by Nirvana in their album ‘Nevermind’. This song sounds like a bass line, and it only uses 2 frets. The riff is actually in ‘D standard’ tuning, so you should tune it down if you want it to sound like the proper one. 
</p><hr style="width:50%;text-align:center;margin-left:auto">
<h2>MONEY - Pink Floyd</h2>
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpbbuaIA3Ds" target="_blank"><img src="Dark_Side_of_the_Moon.png" alt="The Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd (1971)" title="The Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd (1971)" height="450" width="450" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
    <p>This song was released as a single  in 1971 by Pink Floyd, in their album ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’. The song is in a 7/4 time signature, and has a keyboard and guitar solo. The riff itself is not hard, but has some muting, which may be hard. At different parts, there is bending, and the whole song revolves around that riff, with other riffs which are also easy to learn. 
</p><hr style="width:50%;text-align:center;margin-left:auto">

    <h2>LA BAMBA - Richie Valens</h2>
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BycLmWI97Nc" target="_blank"><img src="Ritchie_Valens_1959.jpg" alt="Richie Valens - Richie Valens (1958)" title="Richie Valens - Richie Valens (1958)" height="450" width="450" class="album"></a><!--Album cover image links to the song on Youtube-->
<p>This song was released in 1958 in the album ‘Richie Valens’, released by Richie Valens, who died in the famous plane crash which killed him, along with The Big Bopper, and Buddy Holly. This song has also been covered by Los Lobos, though I prefer this version. The riff is pretty repetitive and will help improve your picking.
