    <p>The songs in this list are songs that have good guitar riffs. There are three pages, each for 
        <a href="Riffs%20-%20Easy.html">Easy</a>, 
        <a href="Riffs%20-%20Medium.html">Medium</a>, and 
        <a href="Riffs%20-%20Hard.html">Hard</a>.
        These riffs are mostly classic riffs that most people could recognise in an instant, and are great to play when you pick up your guitar, and want to play something simple as a warm up. 

But I find it hard to explain guitar techniques and notes in words, so there is not much of a detail about the riffs, but if you want to, you can search them up on Ultimate Guitar, and learn it yourself. 
This list includes songs from artists like The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Dire Straits and Van Halen.

<h2>BLACK DOG - Led Zeppelin</h2>
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIReHbOmU1U" target="_blank"><img src="Untitled.jpg" height="450" width="450" title="Led Zeppelin IV - Led Zeppelin (1971)" alt="Led Zeppelin IV - Led Zeppelin (1971)" class="album"></a>
<p>This song was released in 1971 as a single by Led Zeppelin in their untitled album, which is commonly known as “Led Zeppelin IV ''. The verse structure is one line, the riff. One line, then the riff. It goes on that way for all the verses. The riff itself is pretty long, compared to other riffs, and has bends and hammer ons and pull offs. This riff is a rock classic, so you should learn it. If you want a more acoustic riff, try ‘Stairway to heaven’ which I will talk about in the <a href="Solos.html">Solos</a> section.</p><hr style="width:50%;text-align:center;margin-left:auto">

<h2>PURPLE HAZE - The Jimi Hendrix Experience</h2>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGoDaYjdfSg&list=PLglUu7rOaMDvV15pylVp6iC2Wkkf7q2sy&index=1" target="_blank"><img src="Are%20you%20experienced.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="Are you experienced - The Jimi Hendrix Experience (1967)" title="Are you experienced - The Jimi Hendrix Experience (1967)" class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1967 by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The riff is played by Jimi Hendrix, one of the most famous guitarists of all time. It starts off with a bass sound, then to the riff with lots of bends, and sliding up and down, with many guitar effects. Try just moving the switch on the guitar, or tuning your amp so that it sounds similar if you don't have any pedals.

<h2>BAD TO THE BONE - George Thorogood & The Destroyers</h2>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KciRaANKmo" target="_blank"><img src="Bad%20to%20the%20bone.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="BAD TO THE BONE - George Thorogood & The Destroyers" title="BAD TO THE BONE - George Thorogood & The Destroyers" class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1982 by George Thorogood & The Destroyers, in their album ‘Bad to the Bone’. I would say that the first three bars of the riff are easy. After that, each riff has an extra part added right after, so it may be hard to keep up. The extra part is a slide up and down most of the time, with an occasional few notes. This is one of the most badass riffs, if you wanted to know.

<h2>LAYLA - Derek and the Dominoes</h2>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TngViNw2pOo" target="_blank"><img src="layla%20and%20other%20assorted%20love%20songs.jpg" height="450" width="450" title="LAYLA - Derek and the Dominoes" alt="LAYLA - Derek and the Dominoes" class="album"></a>
<p> This song was released in 1970 as a single by Derek and the Dominoes in their only studio album ‘Layla and other assorted love songs’. The song was inspired by a poem called ‘Layla and Manjun’, and this song was written by Eric Clapton to express his feelings for Patti Boyd, then wife of George Harison. This riff uses a lot of bending and vibrato in the high part, while there is a second guitar playing in the background as well. There is a 13 and 15 bend on the high E string, but since I am scared of snapping the string, I play the 13 bend as a normal 15, and the 15 bend as a normal 17. This riff is good to learn, as it is one of the most famous from one of the best guitarists.

 <h2>MONEY FOR NOTHING - Dire Straits</h2>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRDgihVDEko" target="_blank"><img src="Brothers%20in%20arms.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="MONEY FOR NOTHING - Dire Straits" title="MONEY FOR NOTHING - Dire Straits" class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1985 as a single by Dire Straits, in their album ‘Brothers in arms’. The riff is played by Mark Knopfler, another great guitarist, who plays in fingerstyle all the time, and has a unique guitar sound that you can pick out. The song uses amp effects and wah-wah pedals and many effects to give it the sound it is famous for. The riff is pretty hard, and uses harmonic notes, and pull ons and bends.Once you play this, it is something that you can be proud of.

<h2>SWEET HOME ALABAMA - Lynyrd Skynyrd</h2>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdDT4P6oY10" target="_blank"><img src="Second%20helping.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="SWEET HOME ALABAMA - Lynyrd Skynyrd" title="SWEET HOME ALABAMA - Lynyrd Skynyrd" class="album"></a>
<p>This song was released in 1974 by Lynyrd Skynyrd in their album ‘Second helpings’. This song and riff is a song that everyone knows, and the song was written as a response to Neil Young’s song which attacked Alabama. The riff is easy, but learn the chord shapes first, then it will be easier to play the riff. It has become an anthem for the state of Alabama. This is actually a two guitar song, as one guitar plays the riff, and one guitar playing a little bit over it.

    <h2>THUNDERSTRUCK - AC/DC</h2>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_7SxoQW11g" target="_blank"><img src="Razor%20edge.jpg" alt="THUNDERSTRUCK - AC/DC" height="450" width="450" class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released as a single in 1990 by AC/DC in their album ‘The Razors edge’. The riff is played by Angus Young, and is a very fast-paced one. The riff is played one-handed by Angus Young in the video, so try it that way if you wish. If not, use your other hand for picking. The riff is just hammer-ons and pull-offs, but done really really fast, and travelling to different frets quickly. But once you get it, I think that it might be simple to understand.

<h2>SWEET CHILD O'MINE - Guns N'Roses</h2>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn7TgsI7A3w" target="_blank"><img src="Appetite%20for%20destruction.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="SWEET CHILD O'MINE - Guns N'Roses" title="SWEET CHILD O'MINE - Guns N'Roses" class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1987 as a single by Guns N’Roses for their album ‘Appetite for Destruction. The riff was made by the guitarist Slash, who was using that riff to warm up before recordings, when frontman Axl Rose thought it would be a good idea to make it into a song. The riff is originally played with an Eb tuning, but you can play it with standard tuning, just bringing every note down. The riff is pretty simple in tune, but some people may find it hard to move the fingers around in the right positions. 
</p><hr style="width:50%;text-align:center;margin-left:auto">

<h2>AIN'T TALKIN' BOUT LOVE - Van Halen</h2>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-IUB62zDlA" target="_blank"><img src="Van%20Halen.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="AIN'T TALKIN' BOUT LOVE - Van Halen" title="AIN'T TALKIN' BOUT LOVE - Van Halen" class="album"></a>
    <p>This song was released in 1978 as a single by Van Halen, in their album ‘Van Halen’. The riff is played by Eddie Van Halen, and is tuned down one semitone to Eb. The riff is not too fast, so it should be easy enough to track along. This riff requires palm muting, distortion and guitar effect to sound like the original recording.

<h2>BROWN EYED GIRL - Van Morrison</h2>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfmkgQRmmeE" target="_blank"><img src="Blowin%20your%20mind.jpg" height="450" width="450" alt="BROWN EYED GIRL = Van Morrison" title="BROWN EYED GIRL = Van Morrison" class="album"></a>
<p>This song was released as a single in 1967 by Van Morrison in his album ‘Blowin’ your mind!’ . This riff isn’t really a hard or complicated riff. It has a simple rhythm, but the hardest part is moving the two fingers together to the right place. Maybe try by playing the numbers individually, then play two fingers together.
